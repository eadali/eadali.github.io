AI, or artificial intelligence, encompasses the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, enabling them to learn, reason, and solve complex problems autonomously.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly evolving field of computer science focused on creating systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks encompass a wide range of activities, from understanding natural language to recognizing patterns in data. Machine learning, a subset of AI, enables algorithms to improve their performance over time by learning from experience without being explicitly programmed. AI applications are ubiquitous in modern society, powering virtual assistants, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles, among many other technologies.
